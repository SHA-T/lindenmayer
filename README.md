# Lindenmayer-System
This is an implementation of the context-free Lindenmayer system to create fractals.

You can create your own fractals in the main.cpp where you specify the initial word and the production rules.
The results will be saved as svg-files in the 'results' folder. In the folder 'examples' are some examples of common fractals.

## Requirements
This program was tested on
- Fedora 33, 64-Bit
- GCC 10

but might also work on other versions
