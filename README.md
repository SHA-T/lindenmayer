# lindenmayer
This is an implementation of the context-free Lindenmayer systems to create fractals.

You can create your own fractals in the main.cpp where you specify the initial word and the production rules.
The results will be saved as svg-files in the 'results' folder. In the folder 'examples' are some examples of common fractals.
